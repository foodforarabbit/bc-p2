Quickstart

`$ gem install 'eventmachine'`
`$ irb -r ./bootstrap.rb`
`> Bootstrap.boot # start the child processes`
`> Bootstrap.kill_random # kill random process`
`> Bootstrap.stop # stop all processes`

To use without the Bootstrap thing just initialize Agent with params and config,
where config follows the style of config.rb and params is a single item in the
config array representing the parameters of the instance you want to start. If
you want to start it on the local machine you'll want to replace params[:ip]
with just 127.0.0.1

Decisions:
- used different ports instead of ips since the logic should be the same but it
is much easier for me to set up processes on different ports vs different ips
- the output file is status#{id} instead of just status - this allows me to run
them all from the same folder
- I chose to use the gem 'eventmachine' because it seemed perfect for the solution
which required event-driven logic.
